DESCRIPTION
-----------
All LWTs are mapped to "loads". LWTs in the same load run inside one xstream (core). Instructions inside same 
core are serialized and do not need locks.


Examples
--------
Hash mapping: maps LWTs to a hash bucket according to its Volume ID and LBA. A load can be LWTs in one or several 
buckets. We realize "lockless" with loads and mappings.


TODOs
-----
Other mapping schemes.
