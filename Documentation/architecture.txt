DESCRIPTION
-----------
In this project we use Kunpeng 920 servers. Kunpeng, also known as Hi16xx, is a series of 64-bit ARM microprocessors
designed by Huawei. First introduced in 2015, those processors are geared towards highly-threaded or high-throughput
applications. See details in "https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/hisilicon/kunpeng".

NUMA: roughly corresponds to a hardware CPU die with a memory bank.
For applications which use multiple NUMAs, we usually limit cross-NUMA memory access for better performance.


TODOs
-----
Use env variables or use NUMA info to get platform and NUMA information.
