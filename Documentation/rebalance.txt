DESCRIPTION
-----------
Level 1 rebalance: move loads inside a partition. This is the default rebalance level.
Level 2 rebalance: move cores between paritions inside a NUMA. The rebalancer evaluates the queue depth of
                   the partitions in one NUMA, and moves one core from one partition with highest queue depth
                   to the partition with lowest queue depth.
Level 3 rebalance: move loads between NUMAs. The rebalancer evaluates the queue depth of the NUMAs, and select
                   one partition to move loads from the NUMA with highest queue depth to the NUMA with the
                   lowest qdepth.

Power saving rebalance: when the worklad is very low, we allow to put one or more NUMAs to power saving mode,
                   The rebalancer will choose one NUMA with lowest core counts and move all loads to other 
                   NUMAs. This is done only when level 3 rebalance is enabled and power saving is enabled.


NOTES
-----
Normally we do not allow level 3 rebalance, since cross-NUMA read/write is not cost effective. But for some 
workloads, such as compute-intensive workloads, this is not a problem. The other example is in storage system,
with append-only write cache and write heavy workload, level 3 rebalance could also be turned on.
