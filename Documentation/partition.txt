DESCRIPTION
-----------
A partition is a collections of cores that a mapping of LWTs runs on. That is, an application, or a component 
of an application, normally runs inside one partition.

A partition could cross multiple NUMAs.

A partition could extend or contract, normally aganist another partition.

Now partitions do not overlap, with the assumption that components do not share instruction/data caches.


Examples
--------
For a storage system, one component (cache) runs on parition A while another component (pool) runs on 
partition B.
