DESCRIPTION
-----------
According to our previous research:
1) Power consumption includes power consumed by CPUs and power consumed by dies;
2) Workloads applying evenly across CPUs will consume less power than applying to one CPU;
3) When workload is very low, we can save power by putting a die and its CPUs in power saving mode.
