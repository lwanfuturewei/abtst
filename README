                 abt-st Release 0.1

abt-st is a run-time for storage applications to utilize lightweight thread (LWT)
for massive concurrency. It leverages Argobots as the low-level infrastructure.
This release is a POC version that contains features of mapping, rebalance and 
stackable schedulers.

Many components in storage system use hash table/hash tree. To avoid spinlocks,
these components use threads with core affinity, and each io is sent to one 
specific core with its hash value (of key or content). This caused a big problem:
it is very hard to rebalance between cores.

abt-st aims at easy rebalance while keeping its lockless nature with following
policies:
    1) mapping: all IOs with contentions are mapped to same "load". IOs in the same
                load run inside one xstream(core). Instructions inside same core 
                are serialized and do not need locks.
    2) rebalance: when the loads are not balanced between cores, the rebalancer
                 will run to move "loads" between cores. abt-st knows NUMA configs
                 and will consider rebalance inside NUMA first.
    3) stackable schedulers: each "load" owns a sub-scheduler which schedules IOs
                 inside the "load". The main scheduler for xstream schedules which
                 load to run for all the "loads" in the same xstream.
